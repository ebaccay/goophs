## Goo(gle) Ph(otos File) S(torage)

Goophs is a proof of concept software that exploits the fact the Google Photos can have an "unlimited" amount of photos 
stored on their servers at a specified quality. By using encryption and decryption schemes, probabilistic 
error-correction schemes to combat Google's file compression, database management techniques for file management, and 
the Google Photos REST API to mesh everything together, we have come up with a free, open-source, and unlimited data 
storage solution for college students who can't afford services like Dropbox, Unlimited Google Drive, and various 
other cloud storage services.
